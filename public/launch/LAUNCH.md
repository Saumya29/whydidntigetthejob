## Product Description (250 words)

We've all been there. Applied to the perfect job. Nailed the interview (we thought). Then... silence. Or worse, the dreaded "we've decided to move forward with other candidates" email.

**But WHY?**

WhyDidntIGetTheJob is the brutal career coach you never knew you needed. Paste your resume and the job description, and our AI will roast your application like a hiring manager with nothing to lose.

You'll get:
- A **Roast Grade** (A-F) - no participation trophies here
- **Skill Gap Breakdown** - exactly what you're missing
- **"What the hiring manager probably said"** - the brutal truth
- **Actionable tips** - how to actually fix it

Unlike generic resume checkers, we simulate what really happens in hiring committees. The uncomfortable truths. The eye-rolls at buzzwords. The "this person clearly doesn't understand the role."

Is it harsh? Yes. Is it fair? More than any form rejection ever was.

**Who it's for:**
- Job seekers stuck in application limbo
- Career changers wondering why they can't break in
- Anyone tired of guessing what went wrong

Stop wondering. Start improving. Get the feedback you actually need.

$3.99 per roast. No subscriptions. No BS.
