### Tweet 1 (Hook)
After 50+ job rejections and ZERO feedback, I snapped.

So I built an AI that tells you exactly why you didn't get the job.

Introducing: WhyDidntIGetTheJob

🧵 A thread on why I built this (and how it roasted my own resume)

---

### Tweet 2 (Problem)
Here's the deal:

Companies ghost you.
Or send a template "we've decided to move forward with other candidates."

Cool. But WHY?

What was wrong with my resume?
What skill am I missing?
Did I even have a chance?

They'll never tell you. So I made something that will.

### Tweet 3 (Solution)
How it works:

1. Paste your resume
2. Paste the job description
3. Get brutally roasted

You'll get:
- A roast grade (A-F)
- Skill gap breakdown
- "What the hiring manager probably said"
- Actionable tips to improve

No sugarcoating. No participation trophies.

### Tweet 4 (Demo/Social Proof)
I ran my own resume through it for a senior eng role at Stripe.

It gave me a C-.

"Strong technical background but zero evidence of cross-functional leadership. Resume reads like a task list, not impact statements. The hiring manager probably said: 'Solid IC, not ready for senior.'"

Ouch. But fair.

### Tweet 5 (Why it's different)
Why this isn't another resume checker:

❌ Generic keyword matching
❌ ATS optimization tips
❌ "Your resume is 78% optimized!" nonsense

✅ Simulates an actual hiring manager
✅ Role-specific feedback
✅ The brutal truth no HR will tell you

---

### Tweet 6 (Pricing + CTA)
Pricing: $3.99 per roast

No subscriptions. No accounts. No BS.

## Engagement Replies

**When someone shares their grade:**
"That C+ hits different when it's about YOUR resume 😅 But now you know exactly what to fix"

**When someone says it's harsh:**
"Harsh but fair > polite but useless. At least now you know why instead of wondering."

**When someone shares improvement:**
"Love seeing the before/after! That's exactly why we built this."
