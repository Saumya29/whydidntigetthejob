## Product Description

### Short (for card preview)
The rejection letter you deserved but never got. Paste your resume + job description and get brutally honest AI feedback on exactly why you weren't hired.

### Full Description

**The Problem**
You applied. You waited. You got rejected with a generic "we're moving forward with other candidates" email. But WHY?

Companies will never tell you the real reason. We will.

**How It Works**
1. Paste your resume
2. Paste the job description
3. Get roasted in 30 seconds

**What You Get**
- 🔥 **Roast Grade (A-F)** - A brutally honest rating of your resume-to-job fit
- 🎯 **Skill Gap Breakdown** - Exactly which requirements you're missing
- 💬 **"What the hiring manager probably said"** - Uncomfortably accurate simulation
- 💡 **Actionable Fixes** - Specific ways to improve, not generic advice

**Why We Built This**
After 50+ rejections and zero feedback, we snapped. If companies won't tell job seekers why they're rejected, we'll build an AI that will.

**Pricing**
$3.99 per roast. No subscriptions. No signup. No BS.

Stop wondering. Start improving.

## First Comment (by maker)

Hey PH! 👋

Saumya here. I built WhyDidntIGetTheJob after experiencing the most frustrating part of job hunting: being ghosted or rejected with zero feedback.

After 50+ rejections where I genuinely had no idea what went wrong, I built an AI that simulates what hiring managers actually think when reviewing resumes.

It's harsh. It's fair. And it's way more useful than "we decided to move forward with other candidates."

The roast includes:
- A letter grade (most people get C or below 😅)
- Specific skill gaps vs the job requirements
- What the hiring manager probably said in the review meeting
- Actionable tips to improve

Try it out and share your grade! Would love your feedback.
